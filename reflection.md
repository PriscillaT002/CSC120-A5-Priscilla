- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I understood that with association there were built relationships between the classes within my program. After our lecture I left with the new knowledge of how association allows object instances to cause changes to other instances to do an action. This assignment was straight-forward and all my files ran smoothly after doing what was asked of me in the rubric. The only part that I struggled with was getting the user's input phrase to print on the Pumpkin's word bubble. I am still not sure if what I did for that part is correct. I would recommend a future student to study their notes and to not be afraid to ask the professor for help when they are stuck.
